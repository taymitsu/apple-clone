Clone a Webpage with Bootstrap

To pass this assignment, you must complete all of the following requirements:

Pick any web page on the internet.
Use Bootstrap to make a clone of the webpage. Do not use any custom CSS. 
Remember to use bootstrap components: Grid and Navbar, 
Remember to use bootstrap’s “utility classes” like “m-5”, and “p-3” “mb-3” etc to add space around elements.
Remember to use the “img-fluid” class to make images responsive to the size of their parent element.
First work through all static components before attempting to add dynamic components. This way if you don’t succeed adding the dynamic components, you will still have a successful completed project at the end. 
Use the via.placeholder.com to stub out images to start

Stretch Challenges

Once you have everything as close as possible to accurate with only bootstrap, then you can add minimal custom CSS and add custom images.

Recommended Workflow

Phase 1 - Create layout with Bootstrap Grid, Components.
